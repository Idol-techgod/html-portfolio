<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Idris O Olaitan. I am a Web Developer in the making. Now, I am looking for my first full time job
  I have been working as a freelance web developer for the last few months and cooperated with several startups.
  I cannot say with 100% confidence where I see myself in five years or what my big career goal is. The world is 
  changing rapidly, and I don't have enough professional experience to be certain about such things. However, 
  I know that I can provide a fresh take and an extraordinary approach to every project. I am always open to 
  challenges and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and learn new things quickly. I want to become a team
  player and dedicate all my skills and talents to develop high-quality and unique products.
</p>

<p>I am outgoing, dedicated, honest and open-minded. I get along with people and adjust to changes with ease. I believe 
  that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time. 
  Currently, I am looking for new career opportunities to expand my knowledge and be a better person for myself.</p>
